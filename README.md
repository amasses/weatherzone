== DESCRIPTION:

Ruby client for the weatherzone webservice.

== How to use

In order to use this gem you will require credentials for the Weatherzone 
Web Service: http://business.weatherzone.com.au

First, setup your connection - this can be done in an initializer if you are using this gem
within a Rails application:

    require 'logger'
    WEATHERZONE = Weatherzone::Connection.new("username", "password", :logger => Logger.new(STDOUT))

or

    WEATHERZONE = Weatherzone::Connection.new("username", "password", :logger => Rails.logger)

Once this is done you can then query against the web service:

    @location = Weather.find_by_location_name(WEATHERZONE, "Sydney")
